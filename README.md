## Hi there 👋

I'm a third-year **Computer Science student at the University of Florence (@UniFI)**, passionate about **data analysis** and how data can drive better decision-making across different fields.

My goal is to begin my career as a **Data Analyst** or **Business Analyst**, applying analytical thinking, problem-solving, and data-driven reasoning to real-world challenges.

Alongside my studies, I work as a **freelance tutor on @Superprof**, offering private lessons in **Math and Physics** to high-school students. I enjoy helping students understand complex ideas through clear explanations, structured methods, and tailored exercises.

### 🔧 What I’m focusing on
- 📊 Data analysis & visualization
